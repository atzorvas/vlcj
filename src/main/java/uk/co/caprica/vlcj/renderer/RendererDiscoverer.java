// The native API doc implies the event handler has to call HOLD if it wants to use the item, but the API doc also
// says the item is valid until you get the same pointer in a deleted callback
// so i think you can probably choose to hold at any time TBH
// we will need to expose the item so it can be set on a mediaplayer

// FIXME this doesn't quite follow the pattern of the others...
//  although i think i can delete all EventService now, so probably move the add/remove listener back to the main class? or a common base class for all these components, e.g. MediaPlayer, Media, MediaListPlayer
